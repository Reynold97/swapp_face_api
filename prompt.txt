I need you to analyze the following code repo, I will give you the first halve of the code files concatenated, once you finish I will give you the other halve, to make things easier. First, get a good understanding of the file structure. Second, get a general overview of all the processes made in the code, in general, the code performs swapp faces in images and videos. Take your time and think step by step all you need to do to accomplish the tasks. Be brief, I don't need a full explanation of the code, I already understand it, and the goal is for you to understand it.
